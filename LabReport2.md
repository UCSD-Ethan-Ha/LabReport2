- The methods called for the first test are my main method, StringServer, which will be followed up by the Handler method.
- The relevant arguments are the port for the main method and the url for the handler method.
- An example of values affecting the fields is if you were to exclude s= or any value after the -. The index would still increment so that even if you did correct it after, the values would be n+1. I wrote an exception handler to handle this.
