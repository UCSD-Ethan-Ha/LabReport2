- The methods called for the first test are my main method, StringServer, which will be followed up by the Handler method.
- The relevant arguments are the port for the main method, the url for the handler method, and the input for the query.
- An example of values affecting the fields is if you were to exclude s= or any value after the -. The index would still increment so that even if you did correct it after, the values would be n+1. I wrote an exception handler to handle this.

-  The methods called for the first test are still my main method, StringServer, which will be followed up by the Handler method once again.
-  The relevant arguments are still the port and the URL and also the input once again.
-  I messed around by putting no input and also with the spacing (not depicted in the screenshots) and while they were handled thanks to my exception handler, they definitely would've altered the output.
